# Breast Cancer Detection
As of now-a-days we all know the woman of your life can may or may not a breast cancer. Who remebers when was the last time you did a check on yourself and cared about your health?
Here I am with a new project on how to detect breast cancer over a given data set. 

# Model used for Visualization are: 

1. Logistic Regression: It is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).  Like all regression analyses, the logistic regression is a predictive analysis.  Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables.

2. Decission Tree Classifier: It is a simple representation for classifying examples. It is a Supervised Machine Learning where the data is continuously split according to a certain parameter.
Decision Tree consists of :
* Nodes : Test for the value of a certain attribute.

* Edges/ Branch : Correspond to the outcome of a test and connect to the next node or leaf.

* Leaf nodes : Terminal nodes that predict the outcome  

3. Random Forest Classifier: It is an ensemble tree-based learning algorithm. The Random Forest Classifier is a set of decision trees from randomly selected subset of training set. It aggregates the votes from different decision trees to decide the final class of the test object.

# Plan
 Open Google Colaboratory and import libraries then load the data sets next, after this the terms in the data.csv given in this folder will make you understand which sort of data is given to us and on what is our basic idea on which we are going to detect this diesease. Every step is explained with exact comments so don't worry and start coding the basic libraries and data is available to you here.
 Happy Coding!
